<h1> Power BI Build Analysis </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved building a comprehensive sales analysis solution using Microsoft Power BI. The objective was to extract actionable insights from a provided dataset named Canyon Sales, which contained transactional data for a sporting goods company. Using Power BI Desktop, several interactive reports were developed, including total units sold by product name and ID, transaction year, sales region, and vendor. Each visualization was created by importing and modeling relational data to ensure consistency and accuracy. In addition, a custom calendar table was constructed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enable time-based analysis across a two-year range. This table included fields such as date, month, year, week number, weekday, and a calculated workday indicator. Together, the calendar table and bar chart visualizations provided clear, accessible data representations to support strategic decision-making and identify key sales patterns. This project showcases the effective use of business intelligence tools in turning raw data into meaningful insights.
